# Prompt 6: Computational Fiction

> [A story is] a narrative that describes a series of connected events, typically involving characters, a setting, and a plot. It often unfolds with a beginning, middle, and end, and is used to entertain, convey messages, or explain concepts. Stories can be fictional, based on imagination, or non-fictional, based on real-life events. They are a way to share experiences, communicate ideas, and evoke emotions, serving as a fundamental form of human expression and cultural transmission.

## Readings

### Theory

* ["7 Narrative Structures All Writers Should Know"](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/)

### Practice

* ["Methods of Prompt Programming"](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)

## Summary

Further subdividing and nuancing the terminology of our course, we explore narrative as a technology and algorithmic structure. Latest LLM models like GPT-4 do very well with combinations of prompt engineering and structural guidance. They are even be able to suggest narratives given some examples. However, what they're _don't judge_ is quality.

This is where _you_ come in.

## Goals

* Extending/refining our ability to practice prompt engineering to achieve specific higher-quality results
* Gaining an understanding of narrative as a function/technology of time at both high-level narrative (story) and event-driven narrative (plot)
* Discussing the ways in which models succeed or fail at creating equitable, fair, and representative stories
* Discovering other exploitable boundaries and what these offer

## Outcomes

* 2 texts using prompt chaining technique:
  * 1 which extends synopsis below, developing a story using one of the [seven story structures](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/)
  * 1 text of no more than 750 words which develops fiction from your own synopsis and structure

### Synopsis text 1

```
Mushroom, Giraffe, and Elephant stumble upon a secret trampoline hidden deep in the forest, rumored to grant extraordinary powers with each jump. As they bounce higher, they start swapping abilitiesâ€”Mushroom gains Giraffe's height, Elephant shrinks to Mushroom's size, and Giraffe develops super-strength. When the trampoline reveals its true purpose as a portal to an ancient realm where creatures must exchange traits to survive, the friends must navigate their bizarre transformations and work together to unlock the trampoline's final, reality-bending leap.
```

## Process

We will use `GPT-4o with canvas` for this assignment, ChatGPT's interface that allows you to use the prompt you have engineered and, failing excellent results, to chat with the model and encourage it to make changes that conform to your expected constraint.

ChatGPT is available at [here](https://chat.openai.com). Make sure you login with the course's team account and select `GPT-4o with canvas` model.
