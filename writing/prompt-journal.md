## Story continuation prompts

I used the following prompts in the order shown to generate my output.
- You are a writer. Your task is to help write short stories that follow specific story structures.
- Continuing the narrative of the following text, create a 750-word or less short story that follows the structure of the save the cat beat sheet. The story synopsis text you will use is: Mushroom, Giraffe, and Elephant stumble upon a secret trampoline hidden deep in the forest, rumored to grant extraordinary powers with each jump. As they bounce higher, they start swapping abilitiesâ€”Mushroom gains Giraffe's height, Elephant shrinks to Mushroom's size, and Giraffe develops super-strength. When the trampoline reveals its true purpose as a portal to an ancient realm where creatures must exchange traits to survive, the friends must navigate their bizarre transformations and work together to unlock the trampoline's final, reality-bending leap.
- Adjust the story to include all of the elements of the save the cat beat sheet story structure: opening image, theme stated, set-up, catalyst, debate, break into act 2 (promise of the premise), midpoint, bad guys close in, all is lost, dark night of the soul, break into act 3, and finale image
